# Unity-cube-run-game
First 3D game i made on Unity. Basic 3D game were you have to avoid obstacles.

Since Unity's Libary folder is too large for GitHub i put links to a google drive.

The google drive has:
1. The installer for the game (if you just want to play it.)
2. (the libray folder if you want to edit the game in unity)

The uniry editor is 2019.3.13f1
